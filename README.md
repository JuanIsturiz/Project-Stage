# Project Stage

Hello again!! Welcome to my prototype of a project management application.

---

Thank you for joining me in my coding journey!!

### Description

A fullstack application where I put in practice new technologies I've learned, such as Next.js, tailwindcss, next-auth, prisma and tRPC. Project Stage is an user interface for managing projects and tasks.

### Setup

1. Run `npm install` so every dependency in the package.json file installs correctly.
2. Create a .env file and pass the correct information for every key (use sample.env as an example).
3. Run `npm run dev` to start the application on a local server.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
